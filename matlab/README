gpuNUFFT: MATLAB demo 

Run the script `demo/cgsense_phantom_recon.m` to see the gpuNUFFT in action. 

The scripts runs a CG-SENSE reconstruction on phantom MRI data.

To keep the package size and runtime small the coil sensitivities are
estimated in a quite rough way. Nevertheless, the main functionality 
of the gpuNUFFT MATLAB operator should be generally understandable.
